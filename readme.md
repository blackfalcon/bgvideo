#How To Build a Fullscreen Background Video Player

After looking over countless jQuery plugins I have seen a lot of new HTML5 video techniques. The audio and video elements have created a new method of publishing digital media, streaming off a web server. But developers have been hard at work customizing these features to be used within advanced layouts.

In this tutorial I want to look at using big video backgrounds within typical website layouts. I’ve chosen the jQuery plugin [BigVideo.js](http://dfcb.github.com/BigVideo.js/) which includes a list of resources in the documentation. We can setup genuine HTML5 videos streaming as backgrounds behind the main page content. It is not an easy setup, but I’ll provide a clear step-by-step process to follow along.
